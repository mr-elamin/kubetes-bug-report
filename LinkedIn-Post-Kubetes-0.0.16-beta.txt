🚀 Excited to announce the birth of my new Kubernetes PaaS platform: **Kubetes** (v0.0.16-beta)!

You can now deploy your first website **for free, forever** – no credit card required. Just sign up and start building!

🌐 Try it now: https://deploynow.kubetes.com/

✨ What can you do with Kubetes?
- Use the built-in **AI Website Builder**: Simply describe your website (e.g. teacher lecture, CV, product site, portfolio, blog, restaurant, etc.) and the AI will create it for you – no coding or CMS experience needed!
- Optionally upload images with descriptions for the AI to design your site
- Prefer to build yourself? Push your code to GitHub (public or private) and Kubetes will auto-deploy it for you
- Buy a custom domain (e.g. your-company.com) and attach it to your site (e.g. www.your-company.com) with a free SSL certificate
- Or use a free subdomain (yourname.free.kubetes.com)

🔒 Free DDoS protection, SSL, and more

⚠️ **Beta Notice:** Kubetes is in early beta (v0.0.16-beta). Please note: I am not responsible for any data loss at this stage. Your feedback is welcome!
